# webpack-simple-starter

> I did this more than once... so now, it's a repository.

Many of the webpack starter kits out there are pretty verbose, and come with quite a few default loaders. In the cases where I just wanted to spin up something simple I felt like I was better off starting with an empty directory...

This repository reflects what I would usually wind up with before branching off into specifics.

If you find it useful, great! If not, that's alright too.

## Getting Started

Simply clone the repository, and run a `npm install` â€“ you'll have everything you need to have a super basic webpack application structure.

## Tips + Tricks

I've added a few `npm` `scripts` you might find useful, they are essentially aliases to the local modules so you'll likely want to use the `npm` `--` argument flag.

`npm run webpack`

ex: `npm run webpack -- --output=dist/main.js`

`npm run webpack-dev-server`

ex: `npm run webpack-dev-server -- --host=0.0.0.0`

_The `package.json` file is there mostly for scaffolding purposes, the code in this repository is licensed under the repository provided license._

I've attempted to set up the `webpack.config.js` in a simple yet customizable way. For those new to webpack it might look a little strange, but the idea is you can remove the chunks you don't need/want a little easier.


## Next Steps

Out of the box you're not tied into much other than the default entry point being `source/index.js`. My usual next step is adding a `index.html` to my `output.path` (`webpack.config.js:L10`) and then running `npm run webpack-dev-server -- --content-base={output.path}`, but maybe it's not yours...

### Example `build/index.html`

```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Welcome to webpack-simple-kit</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Hey!</h1>
            <script src="/bundle.js"></script>
        </body>
    </html>
```
